# ME-396P-Final-Project-cantcode.py
## Purpose:
The purpose and goal of this project is to create a visual tool that depicts a robot's movement in a manufacturing environment. In this manufacturing environment, there are dynamic and static obstacles. As a group, we used real-time motion planning and implemented those common algorithms while assessing the scalability. With an arbitrary time constraint, our group looked at whether certain motion planning algorithms are able to find an optimal path through this manufacturing environment while staying under that time constraint. If you would like to learn more about our project, below is a google presentation that walks through the basic processes while showing more advanced demonstrations of our code.

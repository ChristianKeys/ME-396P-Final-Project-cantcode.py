# ME-396P-Final-Project-cantcode.py
## Purpose:
The purpose and goal of this project is to create a visual tool that depicts a robot's movement in a manufacturing environment. In this manufacturing environment, there are dynamic and static obstacles. As a group, we used real-time motion planning and implemented those common algorithms while assessing the scalability. With an arbitrary time constraint, our group looked at whether certain motion planning algorithms are able to find an optimal path through this manufacturing environment while staying under that time constraint. If you would like to learn more about our project, below is a google presentation that walks through the basic processes while showing more advanced demonstrations of our code.

## How to Run Simulations:

External Packages Needed: Numpy, Matplotlib, Random, Time and Glob

DISCLAIMER: YOU MUST DOWNLOAD ZIP FILE TO BE ABLE TO RUN ALL OF THE SIMULATIONS AS MANY LOCAL PACKAGES ARE PRESENT IN OUR PROJECT

Steps to run simulation:

1. Download zip file from this repository
2. Make sure all files from the repository are in the same folder
3. Open up any file that starts with the word "test"
4. Run test files and the simulations will pop up. Note: Type of algorithm can be changed (Dijkstra and Astar).
